I envisioned each piece being a mini box that I could put some sort of very small electronic piece inside of that corresponded to whatever number was on the outside of the box.</h5>
                        <h5>Box #1 (download stl file for box <a download href="./wk5media/wk5stl/smBoxBottom.stl" class="tertiary-colored">bottom</a> and box <a download href="./wk5media/wk5stl/smBoxTop.stl" class="tertiary-colored">lid</a>)</h5> 
                        <h5 class="range">I watched a youtube tutorial on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0NVC8xhf3I" class="tertiary-colored">snap fit boxes</a> to try to make a very small box with snap closures on two opposite sides in Fusion360. I parameterized the box so that if it worked well, I could size it up a bit and print it again. My first iteration was a relatively short print of around 30 minutes (not as short as my one minute toast for lab but still pretty good). I think it turned out very small and cute but I do not think the snaps worked very well--one of them broke a bit and the little piece that sticks out to fit into the snap joint hole made it very difficult to actually close the box. Once the box was closed, though, the lid and bottom fit pretty well together I think because of the registration ridge (the last part of the above youtube tutorial).</h5>

For this second iteration, I changed the parameters to make the box slightly larger and a square rather than a rectangular base (30mm x 30mm). I tried to make the snap joints sturdier by increasing the length of the joint attached to the inside of the lid but also more useful by make the part the sticks out slightly longer. I also added a slightly raised number 1 to the top of the box to make it closer to what I wanted for my final project. Because of this, though, I had to print with supports for the lid since the number made the top lid surface not completely flat. The print still took a little less than an hour, except it took a bit longer because the prints on the printer I was using wouldn't stick and kept peeling up off of the printer bed (even after Bobby showed me how to recalibrate the printer z-axis). Once I switched printers and finished the print, it took me ages to remove all of the support parts with pliers (maybe because I started removing them without pliers and just my fingers which may have just made everything harder for myself once I actually started using the pliers...). This box also still had the issue of it being super difficult to close and one of the joints completely snapped in half (oops), although even with just one joint, the box still held shut pretty well. However, I decided to change my method of closing the box for my next iteration.</h5>

I did still want a way to keep the box more securely shut, though, so I decided to try to add in holes for very small screws that could be inserted to close the box. I based the measurements of the holes on a random <a target="_blank" href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/ym4AAOSwltNgg25R/s-l1600.jpg" class="tertiary-colored">chart from google</a> on M1.6 screws (since I wasn't at the actual lab at that time), giving a very small margin of error (making the holes 0.1mm to 0.25mm larger than the screw measurements) since we were told that the 3D printer usually makes things a bit larger than your design. I decided to not add any holes for nuts to secure the screws mostly becuase I couldn't find any nuts that were small enough and figured I could add that in later if necessary. I also watched a tutorial on how to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2uuQiPl7WA" class="tertiary-colored">add text</a> to your Fusion designs, since I realized that it was definitely a not very smart idea to try to make all of the numbers out of shapes and a much more time efficient idea to just use an already-made font. I also made the inner empty part of the box a 26mm circle after looking around a bit for things that I might be able to use as tags for each number piece (based this on a bunch of 25mm circle NFC tags I kept seeing on amazon, but of course this is subject to change since I do not actually know yet what type of mechanism I will be using). This type of box was also nice because I could print the lid flat on its bottom surface without support print pieces. Again, the print took a little under an hour to finish, and I am very happy with how it turned out! The lid slides in very smoothly and the holes for the screws line up. I tried to fit a M1.6 screw into the hole but it was too large, so I went down a size to the M1.4 screw and it fit super well. It was even super hard to get out of the hole and I had to use a magnet to remove it, which I guess is good since the whole point of the screw is to keep the box shut.</h5>

Lucky for me, when I got to lab Kassia was there (and no one else was) so I got lots of help from her yay! The main problem that I ran into was that the fossil was pretty dark, but when I used the dark object setting for the scan it still picked up the little turn table underneath the fossil. I tried to fix this issue by putting a paper towel between the turn table and the fossil to cover up the turn table, but even in the dark object setting, the scan picked up both the fossil and the paper towel. Kassia also moved one of the giant lights from the photobooth over to the corner with the scanner which helped but the scanner was still picking up the surface underneath the fossil.</h5>
                        <h5 class="range">Luckily, after I did three scans of the fossil (one of the top of the fossil on the turn table, one of the top on the paper towel, and one of the bottom of the fossil on the paper towel) Kassia figured out how to remove these extra surfaces from the individual scans. After merging all three of the edited scans, the final meshed scan looked just like the fossil (even the bottom surface that just looks like a potato)! I am very happy with this scan, especially since I know that the Harvard museums do a lot of scanning of fossils in their museum collections so this just made me feel like I was doing some kind of scientific documentation work or something. Very cool to see all the different scans merged into one.</h5>
