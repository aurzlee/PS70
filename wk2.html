                        <h5 class="range"><img src="wk2media/LasercutBox1_Fusion.jpeg" alt="Box 1 Fusion360 sketch" id="headshot" style="float: right"> To make my lasercut box, I first wanted to make a smaller version to test out the whole process. The first major obstacle that I came across was just downloading Fusion360 because my laptop iOS was too old (:/) and the app wouldn't open up on my computer. Once I finally got Fusion360 to open up, I watched the panopto finger joint box tutorial that was posted on the PS70 Canvas site (except without sound because I did not have my ear buds with me in class which was a mistake since I don't think I followed the video perfectly) and created a 2D box layout like the one from the video but with slightly different dimensions. This took me a while even after watching the tutorial because I had some trouble with duplicating the finger joints on the edge of the box (turns out I had left units on my variable for the number of fingers parameter which prevented the duplication from being able to use that parameter as the number of duplicates). </h5>

                        <h5 class="range">Once I finally finished my Fusion360 sketch, I was able to use the laser cutter to make my first cardboard box (with step by step guidance from Nathan)! I used the same thickness measurement (4.4mm) as Nathan had in the tutorial (since I was cutting the same material) and the fingers snapped together pretty well which was amazing (and slightly surprising that I got it to work yay).</h5>
                        <h5 class="range"><img src="wk2media/LasercutBox2_1.jpeg" alt="Box 2 failed Fusion360 sketch" id="smalljpg" style="float: right">This box was 80x60x50mm (plus thickness of the carboard), which nicely fit the Arduino boards we were given but not much else aka it was small, so I then tried to increase the size by changing the values of the parameters in Fusion. This did not work at all and gave a very weird looking sketch, so I decided to first watch another Fusion tutorial video and then create a completely new sketch afterwards, hopefully in a shorter amount of time.</h5>
                        <h5>Box Number 2</h5>
                        <h5 class="range"><img src="wk2media/LasercutBox2_2.jpeg" alt="Box 2 new sketch" id="headshot" style="float: left">After watching the beginners Fusion360 tutorial, I created a completely new sketch and was able to create the same box cutout design as before in a much shorter time. And this time the parameters could be changed to scale the dimensions of the box up/down!</h5>
                        <h5 class="range">I also decided that I wanted to add a lid to my box since we will be using them later to store things in lab, so I added another panel to my sketch with an extra lip to fold over and a tab that was supposed to fit into a slot in the front of the box. I thought I was all ready to print my new sketch, but there ended up being two problems. First of all, in an attempt to override my OCD, I decided to try to use the lasercutter without taking a million years to click the play button--this resulted in me missing the very crucial step of changing the material settings, which meant that the laser was too strong for the cardboard and it caught fire (shoutout to Bobby who stomped out the fire and Russell for going to the other room to get Bobby while I stood there freaking out...embarassing). Second, after cutting out the box and folding all of the scored lines (had to use a knife because the scoring wasn't strong enough), it came to my attention that I had put the slot for the closing tab on the wrong third of the front face of my box (I cut the correctly placed slot with a knife afterwards).</h5>

                        <h5>Box Number 3</h5>
                        <h5 class="range"><img src="wk2media/LasercutBox3_1.JPG" alt="Final box open" style="float: right" id="smallerjpg">For my third (and final) box, I fixed the slot position in Fusion and also changed the dimensions of the box to be just big enough to fit a breadboard and my original, mini lasercut box (ended up being 180x140x60mm). Definitely got a bit faster with the whole process after having to do it so many times. This time I had Bobby watch me do the whole thing and nothing caught fire yay! And the tab fit into the slot (although I should have probably put the slot slightly lower, but it was close enough that I was happy with how it turned out and I didn't want to waste more cardboard).</h5>

                        <h3>Fusion360 Tutorial</h3>
                        <h5 class="range">Since I had no idea what was going on with Fusion360, I decided to use the very beginnger tutorial that is linked on the PS70 website for this part of the weekly assignment <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc" class="tertiary-colored">(youtube video here).</a> </h5>
                        <h5 class="range">The first part of this video went over how to start a sketch and create lines and arcs. I did not know the keyboard shortcut for drawing a line (just click L and then click esc when done with the line) and I did not know how to create an arc before (dragging the mouse while in the create line mode), so this was very helpful.</h5>
                        <img src="wk2media/FusionTutorial1.jpeg" alt="Learning lines and arcs in Fusion" id="headshot">
                        <h5 class="range">The tutorial then went over how to change the lengths and angles in the sketch, which I had somehow managed to do before but was not completely sure how I had done it so again, this was very helpful.</h5>
                        <img src="wk2media/FusionTutorial2.jpeg" alt="Changing lengths and angles in Fusion" id="headshot">
                        <h5 class="range">The most helpful part of this tutorial, I think, was the explanation on construction lines and using them to do the mirroring action. I had kind of used mirroring on my original test box sketch, but instead of using construction lines, I created a random line in the middle of the sketch, mirrored, and then deleted the line afterwards (which Bobby later pointed out to me would probably mess up the sketch if I tried to change the dimensions later which is exactly what happened...). Following the video, I created a few construction lines, made a couple of circles connected by a tangent line, and then mirrored the tangent line over one of the construction lines to create a closed shape.</h5>
                        <img src="wk2media/FusionTutorial3.jpeg" alt="closed shape created with construction lines in Fusion" id="headshot" style="text-align: center">
                        <h5 class="range">I also had not known about the trimming action in Fusion, which was used in the tutorial to get rid of the extra arcs/line segments inside of the closed shape.</h5>
                        <img src="wk2media/FusionTutorial4.jpeg" alt="Trimming in Fusion" id="headshot">
                        <h5 class="range">The video did not go over how to do anything in 3D, which I might need to learn later, but I think it will help me remake my box sketch much more efficiently the second time yay.</h5>
